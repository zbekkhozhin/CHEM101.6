Although at that point I somewhat understood Amber inputs already. I plan to switch to nvt and enable respa to accelerate MD. I ahd to decrease the time step as the first 100 ns simulation at 400K

Seemed like it just blew up. Later I found out it was just above the MD melting temp. I am not sure how good was the idea with restraining part of the protein, I wanted to ask you on Friday,
but I was afraid I will screw up the other thing you were doing
